The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a webpage as a **tree of objects** (nodes), making it possible for programming languages like JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the page.

## ✨ Key Points

- The DOM models an HTML or XML document as a tree structure.
- Each element, attribute, and piece of text is represented as a node.
- JavaScript can use the DOM to:
	- Access and change content
	- Modify structure (add/remove elements)
	- Update styles dynamically

## 🛠️ Example: Accessing the DOM with JavaScript

```js
// Get an element by its ID
const heading = document.getElementById('main-heading');
heading.textContent = 'Hello, DOM!';
```
